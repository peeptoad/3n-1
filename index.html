    <h1>3n+1 Calculator</h1>
    <p>3n+1 also known as  <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">The Collatz conjecture</a>  is one of the 
        most infamous unsolved problems in mathematics.The problem is
        simple choose any positive number from 1 to &infin;. You will
        then apply two rules to the number if its odd multyply it by 3
        and add 1 if the number is even divide it by 2 and keep repeating
        these steps. The conjecture is that by applying 
        these rules to any positive interger it will result in a 4,2,1 loop.
        If the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting
        number which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1. Such a 
        sequence would either enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase
        without bound. No such sequence has been found. While no one has proved the 
        conjecture to be true or false as of 2020 it has proved true for every number
        less than 295,147,905,179,352,825,856. Try it for yourself enter any number below 
        and press calculate to automatically generate the outcome.

        Example: 5 odd &times 3 + 1 = 16 even &divide 2 = 8 even &divide 2 = 
        4 even &divide 2 = 2 even &divide 2 = 1 odd &times 3 = 3 + 1 = 
        4 even &divide 2 = 2 even &divide 2 = 1
