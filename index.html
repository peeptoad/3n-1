    <h1>3n + 1</h1>
    <p>3n+1 also known as The Collatz conjecture is one of the 
        most infamous unsolved problems in mathematics.The problem is
        simple choose any positive number from 1 to &infin;. You will
        then apply two rules to the number if its odd multyply it by 3
        and add 1 if the number is even divide it by 2 and keep repeating
        these steps. The conjecture is that by applying 
        these rules to any positive interger it will result in a 4,2,1 loop. 
        While no one has proved the conjecture as of 2020 it has proved true 
        for every number less than 295,147,905,179,352,825,856.

        Example: 5 odd &times 3 + 1 = 16 even &divide 2 = 8 even &divide 2 = 
        4 even &divide 2 = 2 even &divide 2 = 1 odd &times 3 = 3 + 1 = 
        4 even &divide 2 = 2 even &divide 2 = 1
